# Music Generation with AI

Welcome to the my repository! This project demonstrates the use of deep learning techniques for generating music using Artificial Intelligence. The goal is to explore AI-powered music generation through Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ujwal-23/CodeAlpha_Music-Generation-with-AI.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd CodeAlpha_Music-Generation-with-AI
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Preprocess your music data using the preprocess.py script.

bash
Copy code
python preprocess.py
Train the AI model using the train_model.py script.

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Generate music using the generate_music.py script.

bash
Copy code
python generate_music.py
How It Works
This project utilizes deep learning techniques to generate music. The workflow includes:

Data Preprocessing: The preprocess.py script prepares the music data for training, including feature extraction and normalization.

Model Training: The train_model.py script trains the AI model using the preprocessed data. Depending on your implementation, you can choose RNNs or GANs for music generation.

Music Generation: The generate_music.py script utilizes the trained model to create new music compositions, which are saved as MIDI files.

### Additional Tips:
- Make sure to fill in the technologies you used, and adjust any script names or functionality in the "How It Works" section as necessary.
- If you have a `requirements.txt` file, include it in the project structure for easy installation of dependencies. If not, you can list the dependencies directly in the README.
- Consider adding a section for any specific configuration settings or datasets if applicable.
